# DANGER
This is very buggy & incorrect autostrafe, this is just experiment

For more comfort, files was merged in one exe

# About
Simple program, moves your mouse to left/right

Uses "crosshair" picture to catch your mouse cursor

But if you using it, you can't look at up or at center/mid, only down

To activate autostrafe press "0" key, to deactivate it, hit "9" key
